  ### Finding space-consuming media
  This example groups all space-consuming media in one album.

  1. Make sure "Library" is the selected source
  2. Select `SPACE-CONSUMING` in the `Space` filter
  3. Select action `Add to new album`

  ### Deleting all media in the library
  As simple as selecting "Library" source, clicking `Move to trash`, then clearing it.

  ### Use GPTK's api
  GPTK exports it's api class globally so you can use it in your browser's console.

  Example usage.
  ```
  // getting the fist page of the library by taken date
  const libraryPage = await gptkApi.listItemsByTakenDate()
  // getting the info of the first item on the page
  const itemInfo = await gptkApi.getItemInfo(libraryPage.items[0].productId)
  console.log(itemInfo)
  ```
